                As soon as I began learning how to program, I offered my services
                to friends and family, providing them free engineering and automation
                solutions. Projects include command-line file sharing tools and simple
                APIs/Web Services among others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since leaving BYU, I have provided occasional volunteer assistance with
                the computational chemistry project. This has entailed aid with debugging
                and helping solve other issues.

              <h4>What I Learned</h4>
              <p>
                While programming is enjoyable as it is, I have further enjoyed providing
                engineering solutions to friends and family. One of my favorite experiences
                is seeing my work positively impact the lives of others. I hope that future
                professional and personal projects will continue to benefit the lives of others.

                were able to improve their grades to the point that helped them be
                accepted into medical or dental school.
