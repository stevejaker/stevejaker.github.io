                <p>
                  January 2020 through current has been and extremely productive time for me.
                  I have spent this time improving my programming knowledge and skills. I have done
                  this  by creating projects to showcase my abilities while searching for employment
                  opportunities. In this time, I have been able to learn several new languages/frameworks
                  and greatly improve my programming abilities.

                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>
                  Working in the Michaelis Lab was one of the most beneficial professional
                  experiences of my life. Coming into the lab, I knew python and had basic
                  experience with the Unix terminal. Upon leaving the lab, I had greatly
                  increased my python abilities while learning Bash/Shell Scripting, basic C++,
                  becoming extremely comfortable working in a Linux environment, learning
                  supercomputing (via ssh login), and getting exposure to FORTRAN, Perl, C,
                  CSH scripting, and various other languages. I learned how to automate
                  repetative and essential tasks and the importance of using the most
                  appropriate programming language available for the task at hand. I also
                  increased in my ability to conduct and present scientific research to various
                  audiences in various settings.

                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>
                  I had been tutoring people as a volunteer for several years before
                  this position, however, I learned a lot in this job. Most of the people
                  I had tutored in the past were college age and in this position, I
                  was responsible for tutoring mostly high school and occasionally
                  elementary school aged kids. This helped me to learn to explain
                  difficult concepts such as calculus, chemistry, and other scientific/technical
                  concepts at varying levels of understanding. Turotring sessions also
                  occured in person, via written documents, and through pre-recorded
                  instructional videos. Overall, this job greatly enhanced my written and
                  verbal communication skills and taught me the importance of focusing
                  on simple, effective communication.

                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>
                  Working for Intermountain Healthcare/R1 taught me how to be patient, helpful,
                  and caring in stressful and difficult situations. Additionally, I learned the importance
                  of being resiliant and quickly adapting to changes in the workplace. In this position,
                  there were weekly, if not daily, changes to our job due to the complexity of medical billing.
                  This required me to be in a state of constant learning and vigilance to ensure
                  my work was done correctly and legally. This was a difficult position as I had to
                  deal with a lot of change. This includes: moving office locations, changing teams
                  (requiring me to completely re-learn my entire job), changing systems for work and
                  having to re-learn how to do our jobs in the new system, being acquired by a new company
                  (having to again re-learn key aspects of my job based on the new company's processes).

                <p>
                  As soon as I began learning how to program, I offered my services
                  to friends and family, providing them free engineering and automation
                  solutions. Projects include command-line file sharing tools and simple
                  APIs/Web Services among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since leaving BYU, I have provided occasional volunteer assistance with
                  the computational chemistry project. This has entailed aid with debugging
                  and helping solve other issues.

                  While programming is enjoyable as it is, I have further enjoyed providing
                  engineering solutions to friends and family. One of my favorite experiences
                  is seeing my work positively impact the lives of others. I hope that future
                  professional and personal projects will continue to benefit the lives of others.

                  Since 2014, I have provided free Chemistry tutoring for both high
                  school and college students. Several of the college students I tutored
                  were able to improve their grades to the point that helped them be
                  accepted into medical or dental school.
